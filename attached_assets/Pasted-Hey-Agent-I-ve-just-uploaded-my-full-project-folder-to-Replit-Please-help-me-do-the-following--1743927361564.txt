Hey Agent, I‚Äôve just uploaded my full project folder to Replit. Please help me do the following:

---

‚úÖ 1. **Fix All Routing & Directory Issues**
- Ensure the project structure works smoothly using the existing folders:
  - `client/` ‚Üí contains the frontend (Next.js / React)
  - `server/` ‚Üí contains backend logic (API routes)
  - `shared/schema.ts` ‚Üí contains Drizzle ORM schema
- Fix routing issues caused by uploading the whole folder to Replit.
- Reconnect pages and components to proper imports and routes.
- Ensure `client/pages/index.tsx` or `client/app/page.tsx` loads the homepage correctly.
- Make sure links like:
  - `/symptomChecker`
  - `/dietPlanner`
  - `/medicationReminders`
  - `/hospitalLocator`
  - `/governmentSchemes`
  - `/healthArticles`
  are routed properly using the App Router if it's using Next.js 13+.
- If you find older routing (`pages/`) but App Router (`app/`) is used, help migrate the structure.

üåç 2. **Enable Multilingual Support**
- Add multilingual support using `next-intl` or `react-intl` (whichever suits better with your current setup).
- Reference the language switcher in the top-right corner (currently shows "‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä").
- Configure internationalization using `client/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` and `client/app/[locale]/page.tsx` for localized routing.
- Define locales like:
  - `en` (default)
  - `hi` (Hindi)
  - (optional: add more later)
- Create a folder: `client/locales/` with files:
  - `en.json`
  - `hi.json`
- Use these files to translate:
  - Buttons like `getStarted`, `learnMore`
  - Navigation items
  - Section titles like `tagline`, `description`, `features`

‚ú® 3. **Use ShadCN Components for UI**
- Replace basic HTML elements and buttons with components from `shadcn/ui` where possible:
  - Use `Button`, `DropdownMenu`, `Card`, etc. for consistent styling.
- Add subtle animations via `Framer Motion` for hero sections or transitions.
- Keep design as per the existing blue card UI (refer to the image I uploaded earlier).

---

üí° Note:
- Do not add authentication or API keys.
- Ensure everything works locally inside Replit.
- Prioritize simplicity, usability, and UI correctness.
- Assume the site name is `AROGYA`.

Let me know if you need any specific file content or configs. But for now, fix the routes + setup multilingual + ShadCN polish. ‚úÖ
