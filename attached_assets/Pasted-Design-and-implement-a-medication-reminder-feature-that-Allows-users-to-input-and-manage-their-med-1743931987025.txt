Design and implement a medication reminder feature that:

Allows users to input and manage their medications.

Sends timely reminders.

Stores all data in a secure, scalable database linked to user accounts.

🔍 Features to Build
1. 👤 User Account Integration
Implement authentication (basic or with NextAuth.js).

Store user details like:

Name, Age, Gender, Email, Password (hashed)

Health conditions (optional for context)

Link each user to their own medication records.

2. 💊 Medication Input Form
Design a clean and user-friendly form to collect:

Medication Name (e.g., Paracetamol)

Dosage (e.g., 500mg)

Frequency (e.g., 2 times a day)

Start Date & End Date

Reminder Time(s) (support multiple per day)

Notes (e.g., take with food)

Example UI:
Paracetamol | 500mg | Twice a day | 9:00 AM, 9:00 PM | Start: April 7, End: April 14

3. ⏰ Reminder System
Schedule push notifications or in-app reminders at the specified times.

Use:

Browser Notifications API (for web)

Local Storage with setInterval (for simple local reminders)

Optional: Integrate a task scheduler like cron jobs or serverless functions for exact notifications

4. 🗂️ Medication Tracker Dashboard
View current medication list

Edit or remove medications

Toggle reminders on/off

Status like “Taken” / “Missed” per day
