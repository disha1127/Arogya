Design and develop a smart Diet Planner that tailors daily/weekly meal plans based on the user's health conditions, allergies, fitness goals, dietary preferences, and regional cuisine availability across India.

🧩 Functional Requirements
1. User Preference Intake Form
Create a form to collect the following user inputs:

🔸 Age, Gender, Weight, Height

🔸 Pre-existing Conditions (e.g., Diabetes, Thyroid, Hypertension, PCOS)

🔸 Allergies (e.g., Lactose, Gluten, Peanuts)

🔸 Diet Type (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan, Jain, Eggetarian, etc.)

🔸 Health Goal (e.g., Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, Boost Immunity, Maintain Fitness)

🔸 Meal Preferences (Number of meals/day, likes/dislikes)

2. Personalized Meal Plan Generator
Based on inputs:

Generate a 7-day meal plan including:

🍽️ Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks

Calorie count and macronutrient breakdown (carbs, proteins, fats)

Plans should:

Avoid allergens and restricted ingredients.

Align with medical conditions (e.g., low-sodium for hypertension).

Support the selected goal (e.g., high protein for muscle gain).

Reflect regional food preferences (e.g., idli/dosa in South, paratha in North, millet in West, rice & fish in East).

3. Region-Specific Food Database
Build or connect to a regional food mapping dataset:

Food names, ingredients, and nutrition values across India.

Allow users to toggle regional alternatives (e.g., roti → appam → rice bhakri).
