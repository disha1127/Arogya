Enable users to upload and manage their medical documents (PDFs, images, reports) securely. Each file should be linked to their account and categorized for easy reference and retrieval later.

🧩 Key Functionalities to Implement
1. 📤 Document Upload Interface
Allow users to upload files through a clean and mobile-friendly form with fields like:

File Upload (PDF, JPG, PNG, etc.)

Title/Label (e.g., "Blood Report - March 2025")

Category (Prescription, Lab Report, Imaging, Discharge Summary, Other)

Date of Document

Optional Notes/Description

Use a file input component with drag-and-drop + preview (if image).

2. 🗃️ Document Management Dashboard
Show uploaded files in a searchable, filterable list or card/grid view.

Features:

View document

Download

Delete or update metadata (title, category)

Filter by category or date

3. 💾 Database Schema (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
User Table
(If not already defined.)

HealthDocument Table
ts
Copy
Edit
model HealthDocument {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId      String
  title       String
  category    String   // E.g., "Prescription", "Report"
  fileUrl     String   // Link to file stored in S3 or local
  uploadedAt  DateTime @default(now())
  documentDate DateTime
  notes       String?
  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
4. ☁️ File Storage Options
Choose one:

Cloud Storage (recommended):

Store files in AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or Cloudinary.

Save only the fileUrl in the database.

Local Storage (dev only):

Store in /public/uploads and reference path in DB.

5. 🔐 Security & Access Control
Ensure only authenticated users can access/view/download their own files.

Use signed URLs if stored on a public cloud bucket.
