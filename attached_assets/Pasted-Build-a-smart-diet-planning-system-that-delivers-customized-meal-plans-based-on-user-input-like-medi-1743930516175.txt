Build a smart diet planning system that delivers customized meal plans based on user input like medical conditions, allergies, dietary goals, and the region of India the user lives in. The output should be practical, culturally relevant, and nutritionally balanced.

🔍 Key Features to Implement
1. 🧑‍⚕️ User Personalization Inputs
Design a clean and interactive intake form that collects:

Basic Info: Age, Gender, Height, Weight

Health Conditions: (Multi-select) Diabetes, PCOS, Thyroid, Hypertension, etc.

Allergies: Gluten, Dairy, Nuts, Soy, etc.

Fitness Goal: Weight Loss, Weight Gain, Muscle Building, Immunity Boost

Diet Preference: Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, Vegan, Jain, Eggetarian

Cuisine Region: North, South, East, West, Northeast India

Meal Frequency: 2/3/4 meals per day

Activity Level: Sedentary, Moderate, Active

2. 🧠 Dynamic Meal Plan Generator
Create logic (rule-based or ML-enhanced) that produces:

A 7-day meal plan with:

✅ Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks

✅ Macronutrient breakdown (carbs, protein, fat)

✅ Total daily calorie count tailored to goals

Meals should:

Avoid restricted items (from allergy or condition input)

Match regional food habits (e.g., Pongal in South, Thepla in West)

Follow dietary restrictions (e.g., low-GI for diabetes, no fried food for PCOS)

Support food substitutions and swaps

3. 🌍 Regional Cuisine Mapping
Build or use a dataset that maps Indian regional dishes to:

Ingredients and nutritional info

Availability by region

Cultural relevance and seasonal choices

Example:

North: Dal, Roti, Rajma Chawal

East: Rice & Fish, Sukto
