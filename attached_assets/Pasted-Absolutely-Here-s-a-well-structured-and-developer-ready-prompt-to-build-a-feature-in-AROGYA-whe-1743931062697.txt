Absolutely! Here's a **well-structured and developer-ready prompt** to build a feature in AROGYA where users can input key health metrics like **weight, blood pressure, and sugar levels**, visualize them with dynamic graphs, and have the data stored securely for history and analysis.

### 📊 **Prompt: Build a Health Tracker Feature with Graphs and Data Storage for AROGYA**

---

#### 🧭 **Goal:**
Develop a feature that lets users:
- Manually enter health metrics like **weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels**
- Store those inputs tied to their user profile
- Visualize the trends over time using **interactive graphs**

---

### 🧩 **Feature Components**

#### 1. 📝 **Health Input Form**

Create a form for users to submit the following:

- **Date & Time** (auto-filled or user-selectable)
- **Weight** (in kg)
- **Blood Pressure** (Systolic/Diastolic)
- **Blood Sugar Level** (mg/dL - Fasting/Postprandial toggle)
- Optional: Pulse Rate, Temperature

> 🧠 Use React Hook Form + Zod validation for inputs  
> 📅 Include a date picker (e.g., `react-datepicker`)

---

#### 2. 📈 **Health Data Visualization**

- Show **interactive graphs** for each metric using Recharts (or Chart.js).
- Graph types:
  - **Line Chart**: Track metric trends over time (X: Date, Y: Metric)
  - **Bar Chart**: Weekly averages or comparisons
- Users can:
  - Filter by date range (e.g., Last 7 Days, This Month, Custom)
  - Hover on data points to see exact values
  - Toggle metrics on/off to compare (like weight vs sugar)

---

#### 3. 💾 **Data Storage (Using Prisma/PostgreSQL)**

##### **User Table** (if not already set)
```ts
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  name      String
  email     String   @unique
  password  String
  healthMetrics HealthMetric[]
}
```

##### **HealthMetric Table**
```ts
model HealthMetric {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId         String
  date           DateTime @default(now())
  weightKg       Float?
  systolicBP     Int?
  diastolicBP    Int?
  sugarLevel     Int?
  sugarType      String?  // "Fasting" or "Postprandial"
  pulseRate      Int?
  temperature    Float?
  user           User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

---

### 🧠 **Backend Logic**
- API routes for:
  - Adding a new health record (`POST /api/health`)
  - Fetching historical data by user (`GET /api/health?userId=...`)
- Include error handling, validation, and filtering logic

---

### 🌐 **Frontend Components**
- `HealthForm.tsx`: Input form with fields and validation
- `HealthDashboard.tsx`: Displays graphs with filters and summaries
- `HealthService.ts`: API handler for CRUD operations

---

### ✅ **Success Checklist**

- [ ] Health input form accepts multiple metrics per entry
- [ ] Data is stored per user in the DB
- [ ] Graphs update live with trends over time
- [ ] Filter by time range or specific metric
- [ ] Mobile and desktop responsive layout
- [ ] Optionally show health alerts or threshold markers (e.g., high BP warning)
